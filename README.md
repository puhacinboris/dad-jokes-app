<img align="right" src="https://github.com/puhacinboris/puhacinboris/blob/main/images/dad_jokes.png"/>

Dad jokes app implements google's prefered **MVVM** architecture along with *Dagger-Hilt* dependency injection.

The app uses *retrofit2* library to consume data (jokes) from [API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and output it to the user via *viewModel*.

The app is getting a random joke by default everytime but it can be expended with a search function.

The app also has the ability to share your favorite joke.
